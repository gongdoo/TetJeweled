TetJeweled Manual
Introduction
During the Grok3 announcement by xAI, a fascinating game concept blending Tetris and Bejeweled was showcased. Inspired by that demonstration, we’ve created TetJeweled—a unique puzzle game combining the falling blocks of Tetris with the match-three mechanics of Bejeweled. This manual will guide you through the gameplay, controls, and features of TetJeweled.
Overview
TetJeweled is a web-based game where players control falling Tetris-style blocks (tetrominoes) made up of colorful jewels. The goal is to stack the blocks strategically, matching three or more jewels of the same color horizontally or vertically to clear them and earn points. The game ends when the board fills up completely.
How to Play
Objective

    Stack the falling tetrominoes to form horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching jewels.
    Clear jewels to earn points and prevent the board from filling up.
    Survive as long as possible to achieve a high score!

Controls
Use your keyboard to control the falling pieces:

    Left Arrow: Move the piece left.
    Right Arrow: Move the piece right.
    Down Arrow: Speed up the piece’s descent.
    Up Arrow: Rotate the piece clockwise.

Gameplay Mechanics

    Falling Blocks:
        Tetrominoes (shapes like I, O, T, L, J) fall from the top of the screen.
        Each block is composed of jewels in one of four colors: red, blue, yellow, or green.
    Matching Jewels:
        When three or more jewels of the same color align horizontally or vertically, they disappear.
        Cleared jewels award points (50 points per jewel matched).
        Remaining blocks above the cleared jewels drop down, potentially triggering chain reactions.
    Scoring:
        Points are awarded based on the number of jewels cleared in a single match.
        Chain reactions (multiple matches in a row) increase your score further.
    Game Over:
        The game ends when a new piece cannot spawn due to a full board.
        Your final score is displayed, and the game resets.

Features

    Randomized Pieces: Each new piece has a random shape and color, keeping gameplay varied.
    Chain Reactions: Clearing jewels can cause additional matches, boosting your score.
    Simple Graphics: Built with HTML5 Canvas for a clean, colorful experience.
